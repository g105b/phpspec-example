This is not a real project - it's just a repository for me to experiment with phpspec.

The contents of the repo is from following the tutorial at https://www.phpspec.net/en/stable/manual/getting-started.html

The purpose is to understand the mechanism of running phpspec, to build https://github.com/php-actions/phpspec - phpspec as a Github Action.
